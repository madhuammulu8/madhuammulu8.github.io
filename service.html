                <p style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 15px;"> Reaching this school was an arduous journey as there were no proper transportation facilities available, we had to hike 7km to reach the school premise. This is one of those events that will always stay on our minds, the destination was hard to reach but the experience was enriching. We conducted a series of activities for students of standard 10 to broaden their horizon of knowledge and thinking. For standard 11 & 12 a career guidance session was planned and executed in an effective manner. A projector was donated to the school so that the classes were taken in a more interactive manner. Prizes were distributed to students for the activities conducted throughout the day. Overall it was a great learning experience both for the students and volunteers.

        <div id="tve"> <h1 style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Top Sengatttupati Tribal Village</h1></div>
                <hr>

                <p style="font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 15px;"> 
                This event's aim was to offer career guidance and the School’s Basic need to the senior secondary students of Govt.Tribal School, Top Sengattupatti located in Pachimalai hills. We consider this event as one of the milestone events of Hope Trust as this was one of the most dangerous and trickiest 2nd event after Kalvarayan Hills we have organized till date.
                The odds were stacked against us- hostile village people, destitute road conditions and many more. But our good planning ensured that the event was a success. We started from Chennai on December 6th and reached Thuriayur the next day. From Thuriayur we managed to catch one of the only 4 buses plying to Top Sengatupatti. From there we walked for half an hour and finally reached the Govt.Tribal School. We briefed the Principal about our plan for the day. 
                As already planned we split ourselves into 3 teams of 5 members each and started engaging the students. Simultaneous sessions were conducted. While fun games and activities were being organized for students of class 10, career guidance were being organized for the students of class 11. 
                A discussion on the latest technological innovations was being held with the students of class 12. In the meantime, another team handed over a projector the school management had asked us during the pre visit for teaching students practical concepts that involved more visualization. After each team completed their respective task, they moved on to the next class. Thus this way we ensured all 3 classes-10th, 11th, and 12th were part of all 3 sessions namely games and activities, career guidance and technological innovation discussion. The team members shared their experiences and gave valuable advice to the students.
                Once this session came to a close we disturbed a feedback form to the students. The results revealed they thoroughly enjoyed all 3 sessions and the career guidance session in particular was a standout. During the discussions we made sure students participated actively in various events and we awarded them gifts for the same in the form of Thirukurral books and dictionaries. 
                Additionally, we fitted wall clocks we had bought for the classes during the course of the sessions. The school management were impressed by our effective time management skills and also thanked us for the valuable contributions we made towards the school. With this, event-13 came to an end. The next day we organized a small recreational trip to a couple of nearby places - Puliyancholai river and Thanjavur to celebrate the success of the event. On 9th December we returned to Chennai at around 8pm. All in all it was a memorable event with a lot of takeaways.

We conducted a series of activities for students of standard 10 to broaden their horizon of knowledge and thinking. For standard 11 & 12 a career guidance session was planned and executed in an effective manner. A projector was donated to the school so that the classes were taken in a more interactive manner. Prizes were distributed to students for the activities conducted throughout the day. Overall it was a great learning experience both for the students and volunteers.

A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p>
